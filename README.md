## Classifying Yelp Reviews

Classified Yelp reviews using Naive Bayes classifier and NLP data processing pipeline.

1. Read in the file containing Yelp reviews.

2. Created a column that adds the length of the review as a feature.

3. Created a list of transformations to be applied in the pipeline:

   * Changed positive and negative to an index.

   * Tokenized the review.

   * Filtered out stop words.

   * Calculated term frequency using `HashingTF`.

   * Calculated TFâ€“IDF.

4. Created a feature vector containing the output from the IDFModel (the last stage in the pipeline) and the length.

   * Set up the pipeline and and fitted it to the data.

   * Created training and testing data.

   * Created and fitted the Naive Bayes model to the training data.

   * Predicted outcomes using the testing set.

   * Used `MulticlassClassificationEvaluator` to evaluate the model on the testing set.
